Final version of the game

This is a remake of the game asteroids where you have 3 lives, you get points for destroying the asteroids, and can only move left and right. The game still has a bug with sprite collision where the laser only hits the asteroid at the spawn location of the laser itself. Bonuses in the game come with big achievments, when getting a score of 2500, 5000, or 7500 you gain an extra life. The game starts off slow so you can get thegang of it and eventually speeds up to where more asteroids are on the screen than before. 

Controls: The arrow keys are used to move left and right and the space bar to shoot.
